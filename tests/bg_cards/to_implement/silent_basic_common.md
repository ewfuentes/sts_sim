# Silent Basic & Common — Tests That Cannot Be Live Tests

These tests require multi-card sequences, ally targeting, SHIV state setup,
or other mechanics that cannot be validated in a single live card play.

## Silent Basic

### Defend (Green)
- **Upgraded Defend can assign 2 BLK to different players**
  Reason: Requires an ally player, which is not available in the standard
  single-player live test setup.

### Survivor
- **Survivor discard triggers After Image**
  Reason: Requires After Image power to already be active (multi-card
  sequence: play After Image, then play Survivor). The live test framework
  plays one card at a time with set_scenario resets.

## Silent Common

### Dagger Throw
- **Dagger Throw discard triggers After Image**
  Reason: Requires After Image power to already be active. Multi-card
  interaction test.

### Sneaky Strike
- **Sneaky Strike refunds 2 energy when a card was discarded this turn**
  Reason: Requires playing Survivor first to trigger the discard condition,
  then playing Sneaky Strike. Multi-card sequence within a single turn.

### Slice
- **Slice deals bonus damage with SHIV**
  Reason: Requires SHIV tokens in hand, which are generated by playing
  other cards (Blade Dance, Cloak and Dagger). SHIV power state may not
  be settable via set_scenario alone.

- **Upgraded Slice with SHIV adds bonus to total**
  Reason: Same as above — requires SHIV tokens and STR, multi-mechanic
  interaction.

### Backflip
- **Backflip with insufficient draw pile reshuffles discard**
  Reason: Shuffle mechanics make the resulting draw pile non-deterministic.
  Cannot reliably assert exact card positions after a reshuffle in the live
  game.

### Dodge and Roll
- **Dodge and Roll splits BLK between players**
  Reason: Requires an ally player for BLK distribution.

- **Upgraded Dodge and Roll distributes 3 BLK**
  Reason: Requires an ally player for BLK distribution.

### Deflect
- **Deflect grants bonus block with SHIV**
  Reason: Requires SHIV tokens, which are generated by playing other cards.

- **Upgraded Deflect with SHIV grants 3 block total**
  Reason: Same as above — requires SHIV tokens.

### Cloak and Dagger
- **Cloak and Dagger SHIV interacts with Accuracy**
  Reason: Multi-card sequence (play Cloak and Dagger, then play Slice) and
  requires Accuracy power to be active.

### Prepared
- **Prepared discard triggers After Image**
  Reason: Requires After Image power to already be active. Multi-card
  interaction test.

### Acrobatics
- **Acrobatics discard triggers After Image**
  Reason: Requires After Image power to already be active. Multi-card
  interaction test.

### Accuracy
- **Accuracy boosts SHIV bonus damage on Slice**
  Reason: Multi-card sequence (play Accuracy, then play Slice with SHIV).

- **Accuracy stacks with multiple plays**
  Reason: Multi-card sequence (play Accuracy twice, then play Slice).

### After Image
- **After Image triggers on discard from Survivor**
  Reason: Multi-card sequence (play After Image, then play Survivor).

- **After Image triggers once per discard event, not per card discarded**
  Reason: Requires After Image power to already be active. Tests subtle
  trigger-per-event semantics.

- **After Image does not trigger on exhaust**
  Reason: Requires After Image power to already be active. Tests that
  exhaust (Poisoned Stab) does not count as discard.
